# Structures and Typedef in C

This directory contains programs demonstrating the use of structures and typedef in C programming.

## Files Overview

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [0-dog.h](0-dog.h) | Header file defining a struct for dog information |
| [1-init_dog.c](1-init_dog.c) | Initializes a variable of type struct dog |
| [2-print_dog.c](2-print_dog.c) | Prints a struct dog |
| [4-new_dog.c](4-new_dog.c) | Creates a new dog struct |
| [5-free_dog.c](5-free_dog.c) | Frees memory allocated for a dog struct |

These programs demonstrate how to effectively use structures and typedef to create custom data types in C. The implementations show proper memory management techniques when working with complex data structures. By encapsulating related data into structures, the code becomes more organized and maintainable. The typedef keyword further enhances readability by creating clear type aliases. Together, these concepts form the foundation for building more sophisticated data structures in C.
