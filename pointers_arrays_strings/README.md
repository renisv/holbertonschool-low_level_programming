# Pointers, Arrays and Strings in C

This directory contains programs demonstrating fundamental operations with pointers, arrays, and strings in C.

## Files Overview

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [0-strcat.c](0-strcat.c) | Concatenates two strings |
| [1-strncat.c](1-strncat.c) | Concatenates n bytes from source string |
| [2-strncpy.c](2-strncpy.c) | Copies n bytes from source string |
| [3-strcmp.c](3-strcmp.c) | Compares two strings |
| [4-rev_array.c](4-rev_array.c) | Reverses an array of integers |
| [5-string_toupper.c](5-string_toupper.c) | Converts string to uppercase |
| [6-cap_string.c](6-cap_string.c) | Capitalizes words in a string |
| [7-leet.c](7-leet.c) | Encodes string into "leet" (1337) speak |
| [8-rot13.c](8-rot13.c) | Encodes string using rot13 cipher |

These programs cover essential string manipulation and pointer operations in C programming. They demonstrate how to work with memory addresses, array indexing, and common string transformations. The implementations reinforce core concepts of low-level memory management.
