# Advanced Functions and Nested Loops in C  

This directory expands on core C concepts with more complex function implementations and nested loop patterns. It includes character checks, mathematical operations, and geometric pattern generation.  

## Files Overview  

| File Name | Description |  
|-----------|-------------|  
| [0-isupper.c](0-isupper.c) | Checks for uppercase characters |  
| [1-isdigit.c](1-isdigit.c) | Checks for digit characters (0-9) |  
| [2-mul.c](2-mul.c) | Multiplies two integers |  
| [3-print_numbers.c](3-print_numbers.c) | Prints numbers 0-9 |  
| [4-print_most_numbers.c](4-print_most_numbers.c) | Prints 0-9 excluding 2 and 4 |  
| [5-more_numbers.c](5-more_numbers.c) | Prints 0-14 ten times |  
| [6-print_line.c](6-print_line.c) | Draws a straight line in terminal |  
| [7-print_diagonal.c](7-print_diagonal.c) | Draws a diagonal line in terminal |  
| [8-print_square.c](8-print_square.c) | Prints a square pattern |  
| [9-fizz_buzz.c](9-fizz_buzz.c) | Fizz-Buzz game implementation |  
| [10-print_triangle.c](10-print_triangle.c) | Prints a triangle pattern |  

These programs reinforce function design, loop control, and output formatting in C. They cover practical applications from basic checks to algorithmic problem-solving. The progression builds a deeper understanding of structured programming.
