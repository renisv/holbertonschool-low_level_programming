# Memory Allocation in C

This directory contains programs demonstrating dynamic memory allocation using `malloc` and `free` in C.

## Files Overview

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [0-create_array.c](0-create_array.c) | Creates and initializes an array of chars |
| [1-strdup.c](1-strdup.c) | Returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory |
| [2-str_concat.c](2-str_concat.c) | Concatenates two strings in newly allocated memory |
| [3-alloc_grid.c](3-alloc_grid.c) | Returns a pointer to a 2D array of integers |
| [4-free_grid.c](4-free_grid.c) | Frees a 2D grid previously created by alloc_grid |

These programs demonstrate fundamental memory management techniques in C.
