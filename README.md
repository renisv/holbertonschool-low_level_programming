# Low-Level Programming in C

This repository contains multiple projects written in C, covering the fundamentals of low-level programming. Each folder focuses on a specific concept or skill, and the projects are designed to build on each other in complexity.

## Projects Overview

| Project Folder | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| [argc_argv](argc_argv) | Handling command-line arguments using `argc` and `argv`. |
| [doubly_linked_lists](doubly_linked_lists) | Creating and managing doubly linked lists for two-way traversal. |
| [file_io](file_io) | Reading from and writing to files in C. |
| [function_pointers](function_pointers) | Working with pointers to functions and dynamic function calls. |
| [functions_nested_loops](functions_nested_loops) | Creation and use of functions, and working with loops inside loops. |
| [hash_tables](hash_tables) | Implementation of hash table data structures. |
| [malloc_free](malloc_free) | Allocating and freeing memory with `malloc` and `free`. |
| [more_functions_nested_loops](more_functions_nested_loops) | Further practice with functions and more complex looping patterns. |
| [more_malloc_free](more_malloc_free) | Advanced usage of dynamic memory allocation. |
| [pointers_arrays_strings](pointers_arrays_strings) | Introduction to pointers and working with arrays and strings. |
| [recursion](recursion) | Implementation of recursive functions. |
| [singly_linked_lists](singly_linked_lists) | Building and managing singly linked lists. |
| [structures_typedef](structures_typedef) | Defining and using structures, and simplifying them with `typedef`. |
| [variables_if_else_while](variables_if_else_while) | Use of variables, conditional statements, and loops in C. |
| [variadic_functions](variadic_functions) | Creating functions with a variable number of arguments. |

This repository is a collection of C projects that help build a strong foundation in low-level programming. It covers everything from basic syntax and memory handling to more advanced concepts like function pointers and data structures. The goal is to develop a deep understanding of how programs interact with memory and how data can be managed efficiently in C.
