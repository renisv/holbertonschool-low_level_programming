# Low-Level Programming in C

This repository contains multiple projects written in C, covering the fundamentals of low-level programming. Each folder focuses on a specific concept or skill, and the projects are designed to build on each other in complexity.

| [malloc_free](https://github.com/renisv/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/malloc_free) | Allocating and freeing memory with `malloc` and `free`. |
| [more_malloc_free](https://github.com/renisv/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/more_malloc_free) | Advanced usage of dynamic memory allocation. |
| [structures_typedef](https://github.com/renisv/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/structures_typedef) | Defining and using structures, and simplifying them with `typedef`. |
| [function_pointers](https://github.com/renisv/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/function_pointers) | Working with pointers to functions and dynamic function calls. |
| [variadic_functions](https://github.com/renisv/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/variadic_functions) | Creating functions with a variable number of arguments. |
| [singly_linked_lists](https://github.com/renisv/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/singly_linked_lists) | Building and managing singly linked lists. |
| [more_singly_linked_lists](https://github.com/renisv/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/more_singly_linked_lists) | More operations on singly linked lists, such as insertions and deletions. |
| [doubly_linked_lists](https://github.com/renisv/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/doubly_linked_lists) | Creating and managing doubly linked lists for two-way traversal. |


This repository is a collection of C projects that help build a strong foundation in low-level programming. It covers everything from basic syntax and memory handling to more advanced data structures like linked lists. The goal is to develop a deep understanding of how programs interact with memory and how data can be managed efficiently in C.
